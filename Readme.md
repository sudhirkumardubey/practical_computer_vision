I successfully completed the comprehensive Computer Vision Course Tutorials, where I delved into a wide array of crucial concepts and techniques in the field of computer vision. The tutorials covered image processing basics, feature detection, and video stabilization. I gained practical skills in tasks like edge and corner detection, image alignment, and object recognition. This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in computer vision.

Tutorial 01: 'Introduction to Image Processing Basics'
Learn the fundamentals of image processing, including image reading, display, shape manipulation, channel extraction, pixel iteration, thresholding, and color manipulation techniques.

Tutorial 02: 'Video Processing and Color Manipulation'
Explore video processing techniques such as video reading, display, webcam capture, color detection, tracking, contrast, brightness adjustment, and image blending.

Tutorial 03: 'Image Noise and Filtering'
Understand image noise and filtering concepts, including adding salt and pepper noise, applying non-linear and linear filters, kernel-based operations for image smoothing, and noise reduction.

Tutorial 04: 'Edge and Corner Detection'
Master edge detection techniques using kernels, implement the Canny edge detection algorithm, and detect corners using the Moravec corner detection algorithm.

Tutorial 05: 'Feature Detection and Matching'
Discover feature detection and matching methods using the Harris corner detector for corner identification and the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for feature extraction and matching.

Tutorial 06: 'Image Alignment and Object Recognition'
Learn about image alignment techniques using affine transformations, align images based on feature matching, and explore object recognition using feature matching techniques.

Tutorial 07: 'Image Stitching and Video Stabilization'
Acquire skills in image stitching by combining multiple images to create panoramas, and implement video stabilization techniques to reduce camera shake and enhance video stability.
